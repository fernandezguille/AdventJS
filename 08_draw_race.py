"""
It's time to select the fastest reindeer for Santa's journeys! ðŸ¦ŒðŸŽ„
Santa Claus has organized exciting reindeer races to determine which ones are in the best shape.

Your task is to display each reindeer's progress on a snow track in isometric format.

The information you receive:

indices: An array of integers representing each reindeer's progress on the track:
0: The lane is empty.
Positive number: The reindeer's current position from the beginning of the track.
Negative number: The reindeer's current position from the end of the track.
length: The length of each lane.
Return a string representing the race track:

Each lane has exactly length positions filled with snow (~).
Each reindeer is represented with the letter r.
Lanes are numbered at the end with /1, /2, etc.
The view is isometric, so the lower lanes are shifted to the right.
